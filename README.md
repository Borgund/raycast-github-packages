Search and inspect details for private packages you have access to across registries on GitHub.
With the GitHub Private Packages extension, you can discover, filter, and manage your organization's packages in a keyboard-driven way.

## Search and filter packages

- View all packages across multiple registries (npm, Maven, RubyGems, Docker, NuGet, Container)
- Search through packages with advanced filtering by package type
- Sort packages by update date, name, or version count
- View package visibility and metadata
- Copy install commands for your preferred package manager

## Inspect package details

- View detailed package information
- Browse package versions with timestamps
- Access repository information and links
- Copy version-specific install commands
- Open packages directly in your browser

## Getting Started

This extension provides access to GitHub Package Registry through the GitHub API and personal access tokens. To get started, first:

- Login to your GitHub account
- Click on your avatar image in the right upper corner
- From the dropdown menu, click on `Settings`
- On the left-hand side, click on `Developer settings`
- On the left-hand side, click on `Personal access tokens`
- On this page, we'll create a new access token. Click on `Generate new token` in the upper-right
- Leave a `note` for your token (Eg. `Raycast GitHub Packages`). This will help you identify it in the future
- You'll need to check the following boxes to ensure this extension can perform properly:
  - `read:packages` - Required to read package information

- Click `Generate token` and save this value somewhere. **You'll only be able to see this once**


## Configuring the Extension

Launch the GitHub Private Packages Raycast extension. You can select any command to get started.

When launching a command, you'll be presented with a configuration screen asking for two pieces of information:

- `GitHub API Token` - Your personal access token with `read:packages` scope

You can also configure additional preferences:
- `Sort options` - Choose how packages are sorted (updated at, name, or version count)
